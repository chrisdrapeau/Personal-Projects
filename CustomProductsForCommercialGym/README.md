Made several products for a commercial gym - Warrior Fitness (https://www.warriorfitnesstraining.ca/)

The big project I worked on was the LED Sign. I tested a few designs for the sign to make sure the LED strip could be easily transferred between letters and that the translucent PLA diffuser was the correct thickness. 

I printed each letter of the sign individually, and added a small lip along the base for easy alignment and gluing. Then I installed the LED light strip through each letter and double checked there was an even distribution of light through the diffuser before fixing the positions of both the light strip and diffuser layer. 

Other projects I worked on for Warrior Fitness were the 3d printed Keychains as well as the Logo. Another cool one I did was the Warrior Fitness duel text illusion which I had a lot of fun working on.
