Made several products for a commercial gym - Warrior Fitness (https://www.warriorfitnesstraining.ca/)

The big project I worked on was the LED Sign. I tested a few designs before finalizing the one shown in the folder to ensure proper light distribution throughout, make sure the LED strip could be easily transferred between letters, and verifying that the translucent PLA diffuser is the correct thickness. 

Each letter of the sign was 3d printed individually, and a lip was added on the base for easy alignment and gluing. Then I fed the LED light strip through each letter and double checked there was an even distribution of light through the diffuser before fixing both the light strip and diffuser layer. 

The other projects I worked on for Warrior Fitness were the 3d printed Keychains as well as the Logo. Another cool one I did was the Warrior Fitness duel text illusion which was fun to design.
