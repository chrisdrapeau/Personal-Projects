These items were also made for different family members and friends. With these designs I took an existing logo of the Toronto Maple Leafs and turned it into a coaster and keychain with the number 88 for their favourite player. 

For the band logo, I was able to turn the logo into a 3d file, then created a custom backplate for it.
