I have printed many different custom croc charms and keychains for friends and family members. 

Here are a few examples but there are many more I have made not shown here. Typically the croc charms have random animals like the seals or pig, but I have also made some for engineering friends that would have a pi symbol, wrench, etc. 

The blessed keychain was one requested by a family member, I have had other requests similar to this too which followed a similar design idea.
