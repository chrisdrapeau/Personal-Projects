I have printed many different custom croc charms and keychains for friends and family members. 

Here are a few examples of these custom charms. Typically the croc charms have random animals or a letter, but I have also made some for engineering friends that would have a pi symbol, wrench, etc.  

The blessed keychain was one requested by a family member, I have had other requests similar to this too which followed a similar design idea.

One of my friends requested the huge Rock Croc Charms as a joke based off the common theme of adding the Rock's head to random stls.
